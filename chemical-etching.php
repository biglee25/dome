                    <p>Chemical Etching is a process where the image or background is chemically engraved (etched) into
                        the surface of the metal using acid. This produces a sunken area on the surface of the plate;
                        this recess is filled with stove enamel, which is then baked on for maximum durability.</p>
                    <p>Whilst we can etch any metal, in practice, it is mainly Brass or Stainless Steel, which are
                        employed for this process, as aluminium is normally anodised and dyed. (See details of Anodised
                        Aluminium labels on our website).</p>

                        <p>is the subtractive manufacturing process of using baths of temperature-regulated etching
                            chemicals to remove material to create a recess with the desired shape which can then be
                            filled with stove enamel.</p>
                        <p>The process of making etched brass or etched stainless steel
                            labels involves bathing the cut out areas in a corrosive chemical known as an etchant, which
                            reacts with the material in the area to be cut and causes the solid material to be
                            dissolved; inert substances are used as resists to protect specific areas of the material.
                        </p>
                        <p>Etched Brass and Etched Stainless Steel labels are legible even after exposure to fire and
                            are therefore used in mining and other hazardous locations.</p>
