          <p>Screen printing is a printing technique whereby a mesh is used to transfer ink onto a substrate, except in
            areas made impermeable to the ink by a blocking stencil.</p>
          <p>A blade or squeegee is moved across the screen to
            fill the open mesh apertures with ink, and a reverse stroke then causes the screen to touch the substrate
            momentarily along a line of contact.</p>
          <p>This causes the ink to wet the substrate and be pulled out of the mesh
            apertures as the screen springs back after the blade has passed.</p>

            <p>
              Screen printing is also a stencil method of printmaking in which a design is imposed on a screen of
              polyester or other fine mesh, with blank areas coated with an impermeable substance.</p>
            <p>Ink is forced into
              the mesh openings by the fill blade or squeegee and by wetting the substrate, transferred onto the
              printing surface during the squeegee stroke.</p>
            <p>As the screen rebounds away from the substrate the ink
              remains on the substrate. It is also known as silk-screen, screen, serigraphy, and serigraph printing.</p>
            <p>One
              colour is printed at a time, so several screens can be used to produce a multi-coloured image or design.

              <strong>Techniques</strong>
            </h5>
            <p>
              There are various terms used for what is essentially the same technique.</p>
            <p>
              Traditionally the process was
              called screen printing or silkscreen printing because silk was used in the process prior to the invention
              of polyester mesh.</p>
            <p>Currently, synthetic threads are commonly used in the screen printing process.</p>
            <p>The most
              popular mesh in general use is made of polyester. There are special-use mesh materials of nylon and
              stainless steel available to the screen printer. There are also different types of mesh size which will
              determine the outcome and look of the finished design on the material.
